Readme File for Twitter Messaging Engine
Christian Lanzer
Comp 330

This program will take a 'tweet' and parse it into a list of words.
It will check those words for topic references that start with a '#' and it will
put them in a separate topic list. It will check for words starting with '@' and
add them to a separate person list. It will print our respective lists and by separating topics
and persons from the original message we hope that later we can use those references in a useful way
possibly by having them link to the person or topic that they are referencing.

The program has several unit tests. The unit tests will check to make sure our tweet is less than the
140 character limit that applies to tweets. It will also check to make sure our topic and person lists
are populated with the correct data. All unit tests pass and work when they are meant to fail.

You could use this program to parse tweets and separate the relevant data into lists. Once the topics,
and persons are separated and identified you could use that data for a larger program.

Note: Should be run on Python 3 or higher to use Print without parenthesis.
